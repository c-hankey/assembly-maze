This was a maze game I created in a computer science class. I used emu8086 to write and compile it. You may have to download a version of the emulator for it to properly run. 

This was a fun project that taught me a lot about the fine details of computing at a low level. The maze itself takes a couple minutes to print out because it is stored in
2D array and is looped through.

User movement is handled with the arrow keys. 
If a user runs into a wall, the program makes a noise to let them know.

When a user makes it to the end of the maze, a celebratory picture is printed.
